It takes in 6 input parameters, namely: AGE, SYSTOLIC BP, DIASTOLIC BP, BS, BODY TEMPERATURE and HEART RATE and predicts the HEALTH RISK.

The output is classified into 3 types based on severity: LOW RISK, MID RISK and HIGH RISK.

It is a supervised learning based model which uses RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER in order to make the prediction with an accuracy of 90.19%.

This project is still a work in progress to try implement ANN models in order to improve the accuracy.
